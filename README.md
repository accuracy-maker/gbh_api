# National Energy Market Hackathon Starter Code

## Overview
This repository provides the necessary framework for the National Energy Market Hackathon, where the challenge is to create a control policy for efficiently managing a single battery. The policy should continuously determine the optimal charging and discharging rates, adapting to changing energy market prices and weather conditions. Your solution will be evaluated for its effectiveness and versatility across a range of different operational scenarios.

## Repository Structure
- `battery_env.py`: Contains the `Battery` and `BatteryEnv` classes that simulate the battery operation in a market context.
- `policies/policy.py`: Abstract base class `Policy` which all participant policies must extend.
- `policies/starter_code.py`: Template file for participants to implement their own policy.
- `policies/random.py`: Example policy that randomly selects actions.
- `policies/rolling_average.py`: Example policy that uses a rolling average of market prices to make decisions.
- `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate the implemented policy over multiple trials.
- `team_info.yaml`: File to include team information.
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for setting up the policy class name and parameters for evaluation.
- `results/`: Directory where evaluation results will be stored (generated by `evaluate.py`).

## Your Goal

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages.
3. Update the `team_info.yaml` file with your team's information.

### Implementing Your Policy
- Create a new Python file or modify `policies/starter_code.py` to implement your policy.
- Your policy should extend the `Policy` class from `policies/policy.py` and override the `act` method.
- Feel free to add any additional methods or attributes as needed.
- Additional data sources can be used to inform your policy, such as weather data, historical market data, etc.

### Submitting Your Policies


### Running Evaluations
- Set up your policy class name and parameters in `config.yaml` or pass them directly via the command line.
- Run the `evaluate.py` script to test your policy. Use the following command as an example:
  ```bash
  python evaluate.py --trials 100 --seed 42 --data path/to/market_data.csv
